# Merge Sort verification in Dafny

We derive, from one common specification, recursive and iterative implementations of merge-sort of arrays. 
We provide full certifications in Dafny.

Several versions are considered:

 - Divide and conquer merge sort algorithm using an iterative classical merge algorithm.
 - Divide and conquer merge sort algorithm using a divide and conquer based merge algorithm.
 - Iterative merge sort algorithm using an iterative classical merge algorithm.
 - Iterative merge sort algorithm using a divide and conquer based merge algorithm.
